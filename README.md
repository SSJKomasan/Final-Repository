# Final Portfolio Project

## About the Developer

Hi, I'm Jabot D – My name is Jabot Dixon and I am a Junior at Mt. Eden High School. I enjoy hobbies such as listening to music and playing video games. I hope that one day I can go the Cyber Security route and make a successful career doing what I love.

So far, from the beginning of the class until now, I have learned a lot about coding as a whole. I’ve gained knowledge about different types of programming languages such as C++, JavaScript, and HTML, and I’ve also learned about the unique things each language can do. Not only have I expanded my understanding of coding, but I’ve also discovered that I want to further pursue a career in it and maybe even major in it in the future.

## Project Summary

This portfolio represents the culmination of everything I’ve learned over the past year in web development. It showcases not only my technical growth but also my understanding of user experience, design principles, and clean, organized code. Creating this site helped reinforce my ability to structure projects from the ground up and gave me a deeper appreciation for the development process—from planning to deployment.

## What's Included in My Portfolio

My portfolio site includes:
- A responsive and styled homepage introducing who I am as a developer
- A section highlighting key projects I've worked on
- Links to each project’s code repository and, where applicable, a live demo
- A clean, professional design that adapts to different screen sizes
- Easy navigation for visitors to explore my work and get in touch
